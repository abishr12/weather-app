Building out my own weather app using ES6

### How do I get set up?

First of all you'll have to install [Node.js](href:https://nodejs.org/en/) and
[yarn](href:https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

Upon completion simply run these commands in your terminal of choice to run the
weather app:

* `git clone git@github.com:techouse/es6-boilerplate.git`
* `cd es6-boilerplate`
* `yarn`
* `yarn run watch` or `npm run watch`
* `yarn run start`or `npm run start`

### Where do I go from here?

Well, now fire up your IDE of choice, navigate to the `src` directory and start
editing `main.js` and exploring the wonders of ES6 using this weather app.
